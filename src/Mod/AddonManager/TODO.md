# Addon Manager Future Work

* Restructure widgets into logical groups to better enable showing and hiding those groups all at once.
* Reduce coupling between data and UI, switching logical groupings of widgets into a MVC or similar framework.
  * Particularly in the addons list
* Download Addon statistics from central location.
  * Allow sorting on those statistics.
* Download a "rank" from user-specified locations.
  * Allow sorting on that rank.
* Implement a server-side cache of Addon metadata.
* Implement an "offline mode" that does not attempt to use remote data for anything.
* When installing a Preference Pack, offer to apply it once installed, and to undo after that.
* Better support "headless" mode, with no GUI.
* Add "Composite" display mode, showing compact list and details at the same time
