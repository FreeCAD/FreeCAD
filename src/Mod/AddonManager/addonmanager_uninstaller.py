class InvalidAddon(RuntimeError):
    """Raised when an object that cannot be uninstalled is passed to the constructor"""


class AddonUninstaller(QtCore.QObject):
    """The core, non-GUI uninstaller class for non-macro addons. Usually instantiated and moved to
    its own thread, otherwise it will block the GUI (if the GUI is running) -- since all it does is
    delete files this is not a huge problem, but in some cases the Addon might be quite large, and
    deletion may take a non-trivial amount of time.

    In all cases in this class, the generic Python 'object' argument to the init function is
    intended to be an Addon-like object that provides, at a minimum, a 'name' attribute. The Addon
    manager uses the Addon class for this purpose, but external code may use any other class that
    meets that criterion.

    Recommended Usage (when running with the GUI up, so you don't block the GUI thread):

        addon_to_remove = MyAddon() # Some class with 'name' attribute

        self.worker_thread = QtCore.QThread()
        self.uninstaller = AddonUninstaller(addon_to_remove)

        self.uninstaller.success.connect(self.removal_succeeded)
        self.uninstaller.failure.connect(self.removal_failed)
        self.uninstaller.finished.connect(self.worker_thread.quit)
        self.worker_thread.started.connect(self.uninstaller.run)
        self.worker_thread.start() # Returns immediately

        # On success, the connections above result in self.removal_succeeded being emitted, and
        # on failure, self.removal_failed is emitted.


    Recommended non-GUI usage (blocks until complete):

        addon_to_remove = MyAddon() # Some class with 'name' attribute
        uninstaller = AddonInstaller(addon_to_remove)
        uninstaller.run()
