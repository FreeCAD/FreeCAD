 FCGear: an Involute Gear Generator for FreeCAD
================================================

This is a simple gear generation tool usable in FreeCAD. The tooth
profiles are approximations of the ideal involutes by Bezier curves,
according the paper:

  Approximation of Involute Curves for CAD-System Processing
  Higuchi et al. approximation to an involute.
  ref: YNU Digital Eng Lab Memorandum 05-1

This code is based on the JavaScript implementation of the published
method provided by A.R. Collins in his gearUtils.js tool:

  Based on gearUtils-03.js by Dr A.R.Collins
  Latest version:  <www.arc.id.au/gearDrawing.html>

Also took inspirations from the Inkscape extension provided by Matthew
Dockrey on

  https://github.com/attoparsec/inkscape-extensions.git

The simplest way to use it is to copy the example macro file
gear.FCMacro to ~/.FreeCAD/ (make sure the fcgear directory is in the
FreeCAD's Python path).
