 FCGear: an Involute Gear Generator for FreeCAD
================================================

This is a simple gear generation tool usable in FreeCAD. The tooth
profiles are approximations of the ideal involutes by Bezier curves,
according the paper:

  Approximation of Involute Curves for CAD-System Processing
  Higuchi et al. approximation to an involute.

This code is based on the JavaScript implementation of the published
method provided by A.R. Collins in his gearUtils.js tool:

  Based on gearUtils-03.js by Dr A.R.Collins
