 FCSprocket: a Sprocket Generator for FreeCAD
================================================

This is a simple sprocket generation tool. Sprockets are used in combination
with roller chain to transmit power. The tooth profiles are drawn according
to ANSI standards from the methods outlined in:

  Standard handbook of chains : chains for power transmission and material
  handling. Boca Raton: Taylor & Francis, 2006. Print.

  AND

  Oberg, Erik, et al. Machinery's handbook : a reference book for the
  mechanical engineer, designer, manufacturing engineer, draftsman,
  toolmaker, and machinist. New York: Industrial Press, 2016. Print.


This code is based on the work of David Douard and his implementation of the
gear generator (fcgear) found in FreeCAD.
