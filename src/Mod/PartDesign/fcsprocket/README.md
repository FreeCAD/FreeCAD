 FCSprocket: a Sprocket Generator for FreeCAD
================================================

This is a simple sprocket generation tool. The tooth
profiles are drawn according to ANSI standards from the methods outlined in:

  Standard Handbook of Chains, Chains for Power Transmission and Material Handling,
  Second Edition, American Chain Association

Table 2-1: General dimensions of ASME B29.1 roller chain
Figure 4-24: ANS roller chain sprocket diameters
Figure 4-26 ANS roller chain tooth form

This code is based on the work of David Douard and his implementation of the gear generator found in FreeCAD.
