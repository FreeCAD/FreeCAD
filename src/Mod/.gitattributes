# get all used file types

# in a directory in a bash use
# find . -type f -name '*.*' | sed 's|.*\.||' | sort -u

# in Mod directory for normalized modules
# find AddonManager Arch Complete Draft Idf Fem Material OpenSCAD Show Tux -type f -name '*.*' | sed 's|.*\.||' | sort -u

# search for a specific file ending in normalized folders
# find AddonManager Arch Complete Draft Idf Fem Material OpenSCAD Show Tux -type f -name '*.emn' 


# normalize the line endings of the following files

# standard files
*.bat text
*.cpp text
*.csv text
*.dox text
*.h text
*.json text
*.md text
*.py text
*.qrc text
*.sh text
*.ts text
*.txt text
*.ui text
*.xml text
*.yml text

# Fem specific files
*.dat text
*.frd text
*.geo text
*.inp text
*.sif text
*.unv text
*.vtk text
*.z88 text

# files which are human readable
# but for which it is not sure if normalize is ok
# emn
# emp
# igs
# stp
# svg

# binary files
# FCMat
# FCStd
# ods
# qm


# line endings of the modules commented will be normalized

# this would let git manage the file endings automatically
# to be save this will be commented
# * text=auto
# if used it has to be at beginning of all line ending commands in this file
# furthermore if used it is very important to set the file types
# which should not be normalized manually (like svg, jpg, etc)
# they should be set to binary

# These files should be ignored as it pertains to line-endings
# because they are binary or should be treated as binary
# Since auto normalize is deactivated all these could be commented too.
# needed if * text=auto is used
# *.FCStd binary
# *.jpg binary
# *.png binary
# *.pyc binary
# *.qm binary
# *.svg binary


# These files will always be checked out with CRLF, i.e. windows-style line endings. This
# really should not be needed...
# *.SomeWindowsFileExtensionThatReallyRequiresCRLFEvenInLinux eol=crlf


# use git to manually correct the file endings
# git add --renormalize .
