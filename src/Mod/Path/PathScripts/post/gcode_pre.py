'''
This is an example preprocessor file for the Path workbench. Its aim is to
open a gcode file, parse its contents, and create the appropriate objects
in FreeCAD.

This preprocessor will split gcode on tool changes and create one or more
PathCustom objects in the job.  Tool Change commands themselves are not
preserved. It is up to the user to create and assign appropriate tool
controllers.

Only gcodes that are supported by Path are imported. Thus things like G43
are suppressed.

Importing gcode is inherently dangerous because context cannot be safely
assumed. The user should carefully examine the resulting gcode!

Read the Path Workbench documentation to know how to create Path objects
from GCode.
