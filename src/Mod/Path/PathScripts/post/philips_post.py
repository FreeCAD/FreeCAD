Machines with Philips or Heidenhain control should be very easy to adapt.

The post processor is configurable by changing the values of constants.
No programming experience required. This can make a generated g-code
program more readable and since older machines have very
limited memory it seems sensible to reduce the number of commands and
parameters, like e.g. suppress the units in the header and at every hop.

# When milling arcs there are two reasons to use the radius instead of the center:
# 1. the GCode program might be easier to understand
# 2. Some machines seem to have a different scheme for calculating / rounding the values of the center
#    Thus it is possible that the machine complains, that the endpoint of the arc does not lie on the arc.

# The map {'M1':'M0', 'G20':'G70', 'G21':'G71'} maps the optional stop command M1 to M0,
# because some Maho machines do not have the optional button on its panel
# in addition it maps inches G20 to G70 and metric G21 to G71
