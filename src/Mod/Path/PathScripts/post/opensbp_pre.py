'''
This is a preprocessor file for the Path workbench. Its aim is to
parse the contents of a given OpenSBP file, and transform it to make it
suitable for use in a Path object. This preprocessor, once placed in the
appropriate PathScripts folder, can be used directly from inside FreeCAD,
via the GUI importer or via python scripts with:

import opensbp_pre
opensbp_pre.insert("/path/to/myfile.ngc","DocumentName")


DONE
Correctly imports single axis and multi axis moves.
Stores Jog and Feed speeds
Appends Multiaxis Feed speed to G1 moves
Jog rates don't append to G0 moves
Make single axis feed rates work
Imports CG (non-diameter) arcs.
Handles CW and CCW spindle speeds
if operations are preceded by a comment ('New Path ...)  They are split into multiple paths

TODO
Many other OpenSBP commands not handled
