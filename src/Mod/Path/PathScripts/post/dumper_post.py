Dumper is an extremely simple postprocessor file for the Path workbench. It is used
to dump the command list from one or more Path objects for simple inspection. This post
doesn't do any manipulation of the path and doesn't write anything to disk.  It just
shows the dialog so you can see it.  Useful for debugging, but not much else.
