;FreeCAD LineGroup Definitions
;follows the specifications from DIN EN ISO 128-20
;which defines 5 different base types of lines
;in two different thicknesses:
; * 01: full line, freehand line / zickzack line
: * 02: dash line
; * 04: dash-dot line
; * 05: dash-dot-dot line
; type .1: thin
; type .2: thick
;for example: 04.1 is a thin dash-dot line
;
;The size of the lines can be computed by this rule:
;l = linegroup
;thick = 1 * l
;thin = 1/2 * l
;graphic = 5/7 * l
;extra = 2 * l
;
;Linegroup 0.50 and 0.70 shall be used preferable,
;where 0.50 shall be used for A4 to A2 and
;0.70 shall be used for A1 and A0
;
;FreeCAD applies these thicknesses:
;thin: hidden lines, dimensions, centerlines
;graphic: graphical symbols, text
;thick: visible lines, section lines
;extra: not implemented
;
