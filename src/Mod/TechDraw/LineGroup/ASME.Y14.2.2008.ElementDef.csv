# ASME Y14.2-2008 line element definitions
# NOTE: ASME Y14.2-2008 explicitly does not define the lengths of line elements,
# but recommends lengths that "depict the appropriate line convention commensurate
# with the drawing size and scale".   The values used here are generally those
# from ISO128.
# NOTE: saving this file from a spreadsheet program (like LibreOffice Calc) may
# append empty cells to the ends of the lines. this can confuse FreeCAD.
# element name, length in pen widths
