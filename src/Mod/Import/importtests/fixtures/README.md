Import module test fixtures
===========================

Drop test fixture files required by `importtests` here.

Examples:

- sample STEP files used by GUI import tests
- small CAD files to exercise importers (DXF, OBJ, etc.)

These files are copied into the build tree and installed under
`Mod/Import/importtests/fixtures` so tests can reference them at runtime.
