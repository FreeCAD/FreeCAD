    EXPRESS definition:
    ===================
    The number data type has as its domain all numeric values in the language. The number data
    type shall be used when a more specic numeric representation is not important.
    Syntax:
    248 number_type = NUMBER .
    EXAMPLE 15 - Since we may not know the context of size we do not know how to correctly
    represent it, e.g. the size of the crowd at a football game would be an integer, whereas the area
    of the pitch would be a real.

    EXPRESS definition:
    ===================
    The real data type has as its domain all rational, irrational and scientfic real numbers. It is
    a specialization of the number data type.
    Syntax:
    265 real_type = REAL [ '(' precision_spec ')' ] .
    255 precision_spec = numeric_expression .
    Rational and irrational numbers have infnite resolution and are exact. Scientific numbers rep-
    resent quantities which are known only to a specified precision. The precision_spec is stated
    in terms of significant digits.
    A real number literal is represented by a mantissa and optional exponent. The number of digits
    making up the mantissa when all leading zeros have been removed is the number of significant
    digits. The known precision of a value is the number of leading digits that are necessary to the
    application.
    Rules and restrictions:
    a) The precision_spec gives the minimum number of digits of resolution that are re-
    quired. This expression shall evaluate to a positive integer value.
    b) When no resolution specification is given the precision of the real number is uncon-
    strained.

    integer and real are both specializations of number;

    A string data type may be dened as either xed or varying width (number of characters). If
    it is not specfically defined as fixed width (by using the fixed reserved word in the dfinition)
    the string has varying width.

    the width of these sequences.
    Substrings and individual characters may be addressed using subscripts as described in 12.5.
    The case (upper or lower) of letters within a string is signicant.
