        When a Site previously saved with `SolarDiagramScale == 1.0` is loaded, the view provider's
        `loads()` restore path will detect that this is a legacy value and replace it with the
        modern default of 20 m radius (https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22496). The migration
        is conservative: only values less-or-equal to `1.0` (or effectively zero) are considered
        legacy and will be changed.

        The test waits briefly for the loader's deferred binding and normalization callbacks to run
        before asserting the migrated value.
