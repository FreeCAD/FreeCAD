class ReinforcementGeneric(ArchComponent.Component):

    """
    The generic reinforcement object based on a rebar object

    Information
    -----------
    Placement list with the placements of each rebar is calculated.
    A compound from all rebars is created.
    The shape of the compound is the reinforcement.

    Who is child of who?
    --------------------
    Should the base rebar know all its reinforcements?
    or
    Should every reinforcement know its base rebar?
    Use case: User would like to change the diameter of a reinforcement.
    Diameter of the base rebar will be changed. All reinforcement changes.
    If this is not wanted, a copy of the base rebar is made, the diameter
    will be changed and the reinforcement is moved to the new base rebar.
    In TreeView a base rebar has all reinforcements as children.
    A reinforcement could be moved from one base rebar into another.
    That makes sense but it does not make sense, but it does not the
    other way around. If every reinforcement would have the rebar shape as
    child it would be confusing. Really? Why not? It just would need some
    list or group or whatever with all base rebars. TODO find out.

    Module separation?
    ------------------
    Should ReinforcementLattice in a separate module?

    Additional Attributes
    ---------------------
    BaseRebar : App::PropertyLink
        the rebar base object
    RebarPlacements : App::PropertyPlacementList
        Placement of each rebar of the reinforcement
    BasePlacement : App::PropertyPlacement
        on base rebar could be used in many reinforcements, but the rotations
        might be different in the reinforcements. This placement is applied
        relative to each placement in RebarPlacements. Thus it is important
        for rotations only, because each rebar is rotatated instead of the
        whole reinforcement if applied in Placement attribute. A translation
        could be applied eitheron BasePlacement or Placement attribute.
