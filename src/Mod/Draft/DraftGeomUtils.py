"""Define geometry functions for manipulating shapes in the Draft Workbench.

These functions are used by different object creation functions
of the Draft Workbench, both in `Draft.py` and `DraftTools.py`.
They operate on the internal shapes (`Part::TopoShape`) of different objects
and on their subelements, that is, vertices, edges, and faces.
