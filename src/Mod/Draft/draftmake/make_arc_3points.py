def make_arc_3points(points, placement=None, face=False,
                     support=None, map_mode="Deactivated",
                     primitive=False):
    """Draw a circular arc defined by three points in the circumference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points: list of Base::Vector3
        A list that must be three points.

    placement: Base::Placement, optional
        It defaults to `None`.
        It is a placement, comprised of a `Base` (`Base::Vector3`),
        and a `Rotation` (`Base::Rotation`).
        If it exists it moves the center of the new object to the point
        indicated by `placement.Base`, while `placement.Rotation`
        is ignored so that the arc keeps the same orientation
        with which it was created.

        If both `support` and `placement` are given,
        `placement.Base` is used for the `AttachmentOffset.Base`,
        and again `placement.Rotation` is ignored.

    face: bool, optional
        It defaults to `False`.
        If it is `True` it will create a face in the closed arc.
        Otherwise only the circumference edge will be shown.

    support: App::PropertyLinkSubList, optional
        It defaults to `None`.
        It is a list containing tuples to define the attachment
        of the new object.

        A tuple in the list needs two elements;
        the first is an external object, and the second is another tuple
        with the names of sub-elements on that external object
        likes vertices or faces.
        ::
            support = [(obj, ("Face1"))]
            support = [(obj, ("Vertex1", "Vertex5", "Vertex8"))]

        This parameter sets the `Support` property but it only really affects
        the position of the new object when the `map_mode`
        is set to other than `'Deactivated'`.

    map_mode: str, optional
        It defaults to `'Deactivated'`.
        It defines the type of `'MapMode'` of the new object.
        This parameter only works when a `support` is also provided.

        Example: place the new object on a face or another object.
        ::
            support = [(obj, ("Face1"))]
            map_mode = 'FlatFace'

        Example: place the new object on a plane created by three vertices
        of an object.
        ::
            support = [(obj, ("Vertex1", "Vertex5", "Vertex8"))]
            map_mode = 'ThreePointsPlane'

    primitive: bool, optional
        It defaults to `False`. If it is `True`, it will create a Part
        primitive instead of a Draft object.
        In this case, `placement`, `face`, `support`, and `map_mode`
        are ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    Part::Part2DObject or Part::Feature
        The new arc object.
        Normally it returns a parametric Draft object (`Part::Part2DObject`).
        If `primitive` is `True`, it returns a basic `Part::Feature`.

    None
        Returns `None` if there is a problem and the object cannot be created.
