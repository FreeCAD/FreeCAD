def make_arc_3points(points, placement=None, face=False, support=None, primitive=False):
    """Draw a circular arc defined by three points on the circumference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points: list of Base::Vector3
        A list that must be three points.

    placement: Base::Placement, optional
        It is adjusted to match the geometry of the created edge.
        The Z axis of the adjusted placement will be parallel to the
        (negative) edge axis. Its Base will match the edge center.

    face: bool, optional
        It defaults to `False`.
        If it is `True` it will create a face in the closed arc.
        Otherwise only the circumference edge will be shown.

    support: App::PropertyLinkSubList, optional
        It defaults to `None`.
        It is a list containing tuples to define the attachment
        of the new object.

        This parameter sets the `Support` property but it only really
        affects the position of the new object if its `MapMode` is
        set to other than `'Deactivated'`.

    primitive: bool, optional
        It defaults to `False`. If it is `True`, it will create a Part
        primitive instead of a Draft object.
        In this case, `placement`, `face` and `support` are ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    Part::Part2DObject or Part::Feature
        The new arc object.
        Normally it returns a parametric Draft object (`Part::Part2DObject`).
        If `primitive` is `True`, it returns a basic `Part::Feature`.

    None
        Returns `None` if there is a problem and the object cannot be created.
