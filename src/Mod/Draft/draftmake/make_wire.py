    Creates a Wire object from the given list of vectors.  If face is
    true (and wire is closed), the wire will appear filled. Instead of
    a pointslist, you can also pass a Part Wire.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pointslist : [Base.Vector]
        List of points to create the polyline

    closed : bool
        If closed is True or first and last points are identical, 
        the created polyline will be closed.

    placement : Base.Placement
        If a placement is given, it is used.
    
    face : Bool
        If face is False, the rectangle is shown as a wireframe, 
        otherwise as a face.
