    Parameters
    ----------
    pointlist : [Base.Vector]
        List of points to create the polyline.
        Instead of a pointslist, you can also pass a Part Wire.
        TODO: Change the name so!

    closed : bool
        If closed is True or first and last points are identical, 
        the created BSpline will be closed.

    placement : Base.Placement
        If a placement is given, it is used.
    
    face : Bool
        If face is False, the rectangle is shown as a wireframe, 
        otherwise as a face.
