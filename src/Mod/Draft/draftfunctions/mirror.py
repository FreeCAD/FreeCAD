    """Create a mirror object from the provided list and line.

    It creates a `Part::Mirroring` object from the given `objlist` using
    a plane that is defined by the two given points `p1` and `p2`,
    and either

    - the Draft working plane normal, or
    - the negative normal provided by the camera direction
      if the working plane normal does not exist and the graphical interface
      is available.

    If neither of these two is available, it uses as normal the +Z vector.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objlist: single object or a list of objects
        A single object or a list of objects.

    p1: Base::Vector3
        Point 1 of the mirror plane. It is also used as the `Placement.Base`
        of the resulting object.

    p2: Base::Vector3
        Point 1 of the mirror plane.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        If the operation fails.

    list
        List of `Part::Mirroring` objects, or a single one
        depending on the input `objlist`.

    To Do
    -----
    Implement a mirror tool specific to the workbench that does not
    just use `Part::Mirroring`. It should create a derived object,
    that is, it should work similar to `Draft.offset`.
