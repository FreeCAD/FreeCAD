def upgrade(objects, delete=False, force=None):
    """Upgrade the given objects.

    This is a counterpart to `downgrade`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objects: Part::Feature or list
        A single object to upgrade or a list
        containing various such objects.

    delete: bool, optional
        It defaults to `False`.
        If it is `True`, the old objects are deleted, and only the resulting
        object is kept.

    force: str, optional
        It defaults to `None`.
        Its value can be used to force a certain method of upgrading.
        It can be any of: `'makeCompound'`, `'closeGroupWires'`,
        `'makeSolid'`, `'closeWire'`, `'turnToParts'`, `'makeFusion'`,
        `'makeShell'`, `'makeFaces'`, `'draftify'`, `'joinFaces'`,
        `'makeSketchFace'`, `'makeWires'`.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing two lists, a list of new objects
        and a list of objects to be deleted.

    None
        If there is a problem it will return `None`.
