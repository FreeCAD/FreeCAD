    This is the original class that was defined in `DraftTools.py`

    It must be preserved exactly like this to keep the original tools
    running without problems.

    This class is subclassed by `Creator` and `Modifier`
    to set up a few additional properties of these two types.

    This class connects with the `draftToolBar` and `Snapper` classes
    that are installed in the `FreeCADGui` namespace in order to set up some
    properties of the running tools such as the task panel, the snapping
    functions, and the grid trackers.

    It also connects with the `DraftWorkingPlane` class
    that is installed in the `FreeCAD` namespace in order to set up
    the working plane if it doesn't exist.

    This class is intended to be replaced by newer classes inside the
    `gui_base` module, in particular, `GuiCommandBase`.
