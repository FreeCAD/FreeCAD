"""Provides GUI tools to create Clone objects.

The clone is basically a simple copy of the `Shape` of another object,
whether that is a Draft object or any other 3D object.

The Clone's `Shape` can be scaled in size in any direction.

This implementation was developed before the `App::Link` object was created.
In many cases using `App::Link` makes more sense, as this object is
more memory efficient as it reuses the same internal `Shape`
instead of creating a copy of it.
