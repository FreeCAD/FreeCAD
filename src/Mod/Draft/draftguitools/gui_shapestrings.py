"""Provides GUI tools to create text shapes with a particular font.

These text shapes are made of various edges and closed faces, and therefore
can be extruded to create solid bodies that can be used in boolean
operations. That is, these text shapes can be used for engraving text
into solid bodies.

They are more complex that simple text annotations.
