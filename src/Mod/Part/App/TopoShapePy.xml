        <UserDocu>Revolve the shape around an Axis to a given degree.
Part.revolve(Vector(0,0,0),Vector(0,0,1),360) - revolves the shape around the Z Axis 360 degree.

Hints: Sometimes you want to create a rotation body out of a closed edge or wire.
Example:
from FreeCAD import Base
import Part
V=Base.Vector

e=Part.Ellipse()
s=e.toShape()
r=s.revolve(V(0,0,0),V(0,1,0), 360)
Part.show(r)

However, you may possibly realize some rendering artifacts or that the mesh
creation seems to hang. This is because this way the surface is created twice.
Since the curve is a full ellipse it is sufficient to do a rotation of 180 degree
only, i.e. r=s.revolve(V(0,0,0),V(0,1,0), 180)

Now when rendering this object you may still see some artifacts at the poles. Now the
problem seems to be that the meshing algorithm doesn't like to rotate around a point
where there is no vertex.

The idea to fix this issue is that you create only half of the ellipse so that its shape
representation has vertexes at its start and end point.

from FreeCAD import Base
import Part
V=Base.Vector

e=Part.Ellipse()
s=e.toShape(e.LastParameter/4,3*e.LastParameter/4)
r=s.revolve(V(0,0,0),V(0,1,0), 360)
Part.show(r)

	<Methode Name="distToShape" Const="true">
      <Documentation>
		<UserDocu>Find the minimum distance to another shape.
distToShape(Shape s):  Returns a list of minimum distance and solution point pairs.

Returned is a tuple of three: (dist, vectors, infos).

dist is the minimum distance, in mm (float value).

vectors is a list of pairs of App.Vector. Each pair corresponds to solution.
Example: [(Vector (2.0, -1.0, 2.0), Vector (2.0, 0.0, 2.0)), (Vector (2.0,
-1.0, 2.0), Vector (2.0, -1.0, 3.0))] First vector is a point on self, second
vector is a point on s.

infos contains additional info on the solutions. It is a list of tuples:
(topo1, index1, params1, topo2, index2, params2)

    topo1, topo2 are strings identifying type of BREP element: 'Vertex',
    'Edge', or 'Face'.

    index1, index2 are indexes of the elements (zero-based).

    params1, params2 are parameters of internal space of the elements. For
    vertices, params is None. For edges, params is one float, u. For faces,
    params is a tuple (u,v). </UserDocu>

        getTolerance(mode, ShapeType=Shape) -> float

        Determines a tolerance from the ones stored in a shape
        mode = 0 : returns the average value between sub-shapes,
        mode &gt; 0 : returns the maximal found,
        mode &lt; 0 : returns the minimal found.
        ShapeType defines what kinds of sub-shapes to consider:
        Shape (default) : all : Vertex, Edge, Face,
        Vertex : only vertices,
        Edge   : only edges,
        Face   : only faces,
        Shell  : combined Shell + Face, for each face (and containing
                 shell), also checks edge and Vertex
