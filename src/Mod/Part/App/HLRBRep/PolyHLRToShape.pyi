    PolyHLRToShape(algo: HLRBRep_PolyAlgo) -> HLRBRep_PolyHLRToShape

    A framework for filtering the computation results of an HLRBRep_PolyAlgo
    algorithm by extraction.  From the results calculated by the algorithm on a
    shape, a filter returns the type of edge you want to identify.  You can choose
    any of the following types of output:
    - visible sharp edges
    - hidden sharp edges
    - visible smooth edges
    - hidden smooth edges
    - visible sewn edges
    - hidden sewn edges
    - visible outline edges
    - hidden outline edges
    - visible isoparameters and
    - hidden isoparameters.

    Sharp edges present a C0 continuity (non G1). Smooth edges present a G1
    continuity (non G2). Sewn edges present a C2 continuity. The result is composed
    of 2D edges in the projection plane of the view which the algorithm has worked
    with. These 2D edges are not included in the data structure of the visualized
    shape. In order to obtain a complete image, you must combine the shapes given
    by each of the chosen filters. The construction of the shape does not call a
    new computation of the algorithm, but only reads its internal results.
