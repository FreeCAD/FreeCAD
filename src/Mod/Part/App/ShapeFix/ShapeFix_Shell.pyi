        Fixes orientation of faces in shell.
        Changes orientation of face in the shell, if it is oriented opposite
        to neighbouring faces. If it is not possible to orient all faces in the
        shell (like in case of mebious band), this method orients only subset
        of faces. Other faces are stored in Error compound.
        Modes :
        isAccountMultiConex - mode for account cases of multiconnexity.
        If this mode is equal to Standard_True, separate shells will be created
        in the cases of multiconnexity. If this mode is equal to Standard_False,
        one shell will be created without account of multiconnexity. By default - Standard_True;
        NonManifold - mode for creation of non-manifold shells.
        If this mode is equal to Standard_True one non-manifold will be created from shell
        contains multishared edges. Else if this mode is equal to Standard_False only
        manifold shells will be created. By default - Standard_False.
