        Hints: Sometimes you want to create a rotation body out of a closed edge or wire.
        Example:
        from FreeCAD import Base
        import Part
        V=Base.Vector

        e=Part.Ellipse()
        s=e.toShape()
        r=s.revolve(V(0,0,0),V(0,1,0), 360)
        Part.show(r)

        However, you may possibly realize some rendering artifacts or that the mesh
        creation seems to hang. This is because this way the surface is created twice.
        Since the curve is a full ellipse it is sufficient to do a rotation of 180 degree
        only, i.e. r=s.revolve(V(0,0,0),V(0,1,0), 180)

        Now when rendering this object you may still see some artifacts at the poles. Now the
        problem seems to be that the meshing algorithm doesn't like to rotate around a point
        where there is no vertex.

        The idea to fix this issue is that you create only half of the ellipse so that its shape
        representation has vertexes at its start and end point.

        from FreeCAD import Base
        import Part
        V=Base.Vector

        e=Part.Ellipse()
        s=e.toShape(e.LastParameter/4,3*e.LastParameter/4)
        r=s.revolve(V(0,0,0),V(0,1,0), 360)

        Input shape (self) can be edge, wire, face, or a compound of those.

        * offset: distance to expand the shape by. Negative value will shrink the shape.

        * join: method of offsetting non-tangent joints. 0 = arcs, 1 = tangent, 2 = intersection

        * fill: if true, the output is a face filling the space covered by offset. If
        false, the output is a wire.

        * openResult: affects the way open wires are processed. If False, an open wire
        is made. If True, a closed wire is made from a double-sided offset, with rounds
        around open vertices.

        * intersection: affects the way compounds are processed. If False, all children
        are offset independently. If True, and children are edges/wires, the children
        are offset in a collective manner. If compounding is nested, collectiveness
        does not spread across compounds (only direct children of a compound are taken
        collectively).

        Returns: result of offsetting (wire or face or compound of those). Compounding
        structure follows that of source shape.
