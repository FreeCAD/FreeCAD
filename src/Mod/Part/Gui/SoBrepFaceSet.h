/**
 * First some words to the history and the reason why we have this class:
 * In older FreeCAD versions we had an own Inventor node for each sub-element of a shape with its own highlight node.
 * For more complex objects the number of nodes increased dramatically with the result that interactions with such
 * objects was almost impossible because every little rotation or hovering caused a very time consuming redraw. The
 * most time consuming part was not the OpenGL calls to render the elements but the traversal of these many nodes.
 *
 * So, the idea was to have one node that handles all faces of a shape, one node that handles all edges and another node
 * that handles the vertexes. And each of these nodes manages the highlighting and selection itself.
 *
 * Now to SoBrepFaceSet in detail:
 * The most complex nodes of them is SoBrepFaceSet because it adds some extra logic for the handling of faces. As you can
 * see this class also has the attribute partIndex which is an array of integers. This basically expresses the logical
 * grouping of the faces in the coordIndex field -- the parts. This means that a part in SoBrepFaceSet corresponds to a face
 * in a shape object. Each part value gives you the number of triangles a certain face consists of. That's also the reason why
 * SoBrepFaceSet only renders triangles. If you want a quad to be rendered than create two triangles and set the corresponding
 * part number to 2.
 *
 * Example:
 * Let's say you have a shape with two faces. When meshing face 1 it creates 10 triangles and face 2 creates 5 triangles. Then
 * the partIndex attribute would be the array [10,5].
 * 
 * Highlighting/selection:
 * The highlightIndex now defines which part of the shape must be highlighted. So, in the above example it can have the values
 * 0, 1, or -1 (i.e. no highlighting). The highlightIndex is a SoSFInt32 field because only one part can be highlighted at a
 * moment while selectionIndex is a SoMFInt32 field because several parts can be selected at a time. All the logic how to do the
 * rendering is done inside renderHighlight()/renderSelection().
 *
 * Actually you can access the highlightIndex directly or you can apply a SoHighlightElementAction on it. And don't forget: if you
 * do some mouse picking and you got a SoFaceDetail then use getPartIndex() to get the correct part.
 *
 * As an example how to use the class correctly see ViewProviderPartExt::updateVisual().
