"""
Bidirectional facing toolpath generator.

This module implements a bidirectional clearing pattern where passes alternate between
starting from the bottom edge and the top edge of the polygon, meeting in the middle.
Bottom passes step inward from min_t toward the center, while top passes step inward
from max_t toward the center. Passes are interleaved (bottom, top, bottom, top, etc.)
to minimize rapid move distances.

Feed moves (cutting) are aligned with the angle_degrees argument direction. Rapid moves
are perpendicular to the feed moves and always travel outside the clearing area along
the polygon edges.

This strategy always maintains either climb or conventional milling direction, but
alternates which side of the polygon is cut to maintain consistent milling direction
throughout.

    Generate a bidirectional clearing pattern using scanline intersection.

    This strategy cuts back and forth across the polygon, alternating which side
    is cut to maintain consistent milling direction. Rapids between passes stay
    at cutting height for efficiency.

        polygon: The polygon boundary to clear
        tool_diameter: Diameter of the cutting tool
        stepover_percent: Stepover as percentage of tool diameter
