## ðŸŸ© Core Essentials
*Features present or expected in a basic CAM package and necessary to perform the required tasks*

### All Operations

| Feature                           | Description                                        | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operation tool control Parameters | Configure spindle speed, feed rate, tool selection | tools are configured via the Tool Controller.  The functionality is COMPLETE but not intuitive.  Users expect to configure this within an operation and need to exit the op and edit the TC. |
| Operation Depth parameters        | start/end depth,                                   | COMPLETE.  <br>Terminology used throughout CAM is inconsistent.  <br>                                                                                                                        |

### Pocketing

| Feature             | Description                              | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Entry Strategies    | Provide helical and ramp entry           | Partially complete via dressup. <br>specific strategies are possible but limited and buggy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Entry Start Point   | Allow user to specify entry point        | Start point selection is poorly implemented.  It's not allowed at all in adaptive.<br>When used in other pocket ops (millface) only a single point is allowed.  If the pocket algorithm needs to retract and re-enter, it will use whichever point is needed.  <br><br>Pocket entry point should be studied to evaluate the current state-of-the-art.  Either remove it and let the op set start point automatically or reimplement it consistently.<br><br>Retain starting position from hole to hole when set. Angle in XY set by first hole. <br>
ie retain starting angle on XY plane as determined by first hole. <br>
Minimising rapids between holes gains nothing over all and leads to rather arbitrary starting points. |
| Clearing Strategies | zigzag, offset, line, grid, adaptive, Spiral                 | INCOMPLETE. Spiral pattern is missing and is desirable for some use cases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Stock to Leave      | Set material to leave for finishing pass | COMPLETE.  Terminology is inconsistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Stepover Control    | Set amount of material removed per pass  | COMPLETE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
