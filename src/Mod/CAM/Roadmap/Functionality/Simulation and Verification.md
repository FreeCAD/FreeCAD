# ðŸŸ© Core Essentials
*Features present or expected in a basic CAM package and necessary to perform the required tasks*

| Feature                | Description                                            | Assessment                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toolpath Visualization | Display toolpath in context of model and stock         | Done.  Arrow indicators on segments are too small to be useful.                                                                                                     |
| Toolpath Inspection    | Allow user to inspect/explore segments of the toolpath | Done. <br>Inspection shows the raw internal comands for the segments.  These commands are not in the correct unit schema and do not reflect the postprocessed code. |
|                        |                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                     |
