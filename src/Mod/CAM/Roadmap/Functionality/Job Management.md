Good examples are not shipped with FreeCAD.                                                                                                                              |
| Job Defaults            | Experienced users want certain values to always default in particular ways.<br>Example:  "I always want my drilling retract depth to be 2mm above the start depth"                                                          | opDefaults allow full customizaton.  The functionality is very good but poorly exposed to users. <br>The SetupSheet is confusing and the functionality overlaps with OpDefaults in Job setup.<br>The functionality doesn't appear where users might prefer it - in CAM preferences. |
| Feature Arrays| There are numerous cases where the user wants to create the same toolpath or set of toolpaths in multiple locations.  There are several different use cases that overlap.  | INCOMPLETE.  Some uses-cases can be achieved with Array op.  Others with Array dressup and still others with fixtures.  The functionality is confusing and buggy.|
