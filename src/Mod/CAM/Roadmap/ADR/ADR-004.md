# ADR-001: Standardized vocabulary around rotation of cutter, direction of cut, and conventional vs. climb operations.

## Status:
Draft

## Context
In the FreeCAD UI, and to a certain extent the codebase, we require normalized vocabulary to clearly communicate standard machining operations and conventions to the end-user, and to eachother.

### Rotation of Cutter
**Spindle Speed**: The rotational velocity of the cutting tool, measured in RPM (Revolutions Per Minute).
**Clockwise Rotation**: Tool rotates in a clockwise direction when viewed from the spindle toward the workpiece.
**Counter-Clockwise Rotation**: Tool rotates in a counter-clockwise direction when viewed from the spindle toward the workpiece.

#### Examples
- "Set spindle speed to 1200 RPM for aluminum milling operations."
- "For right-handed cutting tools, use clockwise spindle rotation."
- "When using a left-handed thread mill, configure counter-clockwise rotation."

### Direction of Cut
**Feed Direction**: The direction in which the tool moves relative to the workpiece.
**Axial Direction**: Movement parallel to the tool's rotational axis.
**Radial Direction**: Movement perpendicular to the tool's rotational axis.

#### Examples
- "Program a linear cut along the X-axis at a feed rate of 100 mm/min."
- "For pocket milling, use a spiral inward cut direction to maintain constant tool engagement."
- "When face milling, set the feed direction perpendicular to the spindle axis."

### Conventional vs. Climb Operations
**Conventional Milling (Up Milling)**: The cutter rotation opposes the feed direction, with chip thickness starting at minimum and increasing.
**Climb Milling (Down Milling)**: The cutter rotation aligns with the feed direction, with chip thickness starting at maximum and decreasing.

#### Examples
"Use conventional milling for machines with backlash to prevent tool pull."
"For roughing operations on cast materials, conventional milling is recommended to break through the hard outer surface."
"Set climb milling for finishing operations to achieve better surface finish."

## Decision
1. For all operatons we should default to clockwise spindle rotation, and make this toggleable.
2. For all operations, we must also define a cut mode of climb vs. conventional.
3. Defaults should assume CW spindle direction for all operations unless explicitly overridden.

### Example Outcome
- "A CCW spindle rotation with a cut mode of climb would have a CCW feed direction on the outside of a part, and CW feed direction on the inside of a part."
- "A CW spindle rotation with a cut mode of conventional would have a CCW feed direction on the outside of a part, and a CW feed direction on the inside of a part."
- "A CW spindle rotation with a cut mode of climb would have a CW feed direction on the outside of the part, and a CCW feed direction on the inside of a part."

## Consequences
- Gains: strong consistency across operations.
- Costs: potentially adding overhead if an operation doesn't have these parameters implemented.
