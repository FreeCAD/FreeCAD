# ADR-005: Triggering Tool Path Recompute in Task Panels

## Status
DRAFT

## Context
While the user has the task panel open to change properties of an operation or other document object, we need consistency in when the changes are applied
There are two options.

### Option 1
Recompute the tool path whenever a property changes.
The task panel has only 'OK' and 'CANCEL' buttons.

### Option 2
Apply changes when the user indicates acceptance of the changes.
The task panel has 'OK', 'CANCEL', and 'APPLY' buttons.  The toolpath is only recomputed when 'OK' or 'APPLY' is pressed.

## Decision
Toolpath calculation can be computationally expensive.  Triggering the recompute whenever a property changes may cause UI lockup or lag.

For a consistent user experience, all CAM task panels should employ the 'OK', 'CANCEL', 'APPLY' pattern and should recompute the toolpath only when required.

## Consequences
- Gains: strong consistency, efficient recompute.
- Costs: less 'delightful' for the user for fast updating paths
