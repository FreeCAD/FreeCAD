# ADR-005: Triggering Tool Path Recompute in Task Panels

## Status
DRAFT

## Context
While the user has the task panel open to change properties of an operation or other document object, we need consistency in when the changes are applied
There are two options.  Apply the changes whenever a property changes.  The task panel has only 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons.  Or the task panel has 'OK', 'Cancel', and 'Apply' buttons.  The toolpath is only recomputed when 'ok' or 'apply' is pressed.

## Decision
Toolpath calculation can be computationally expensive.  Trigger the recompute whenever a property changes may cause UI lockup or lag.

For a consistent user experience, all CAM task panels should employ the 'ok', 'cancel', 'pattern' and should recompute the toolpath only when required.

This decision may be revisited in the future if toolpath computation becomes parrallelizable or less concerning.

## Consequences
- Gains: strong consistency, efficient recompute.
- Costs: less 'delightful' for the user for fast updating paths
