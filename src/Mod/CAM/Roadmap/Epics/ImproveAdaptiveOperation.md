# STATUS:

Active

# Why it is a priority

The adaptive operation is an important function for users to make constant load
tool paths. The current implementation has missing features and bugs that make
it difficult for users to generate adaptive tool paths effectively.

# Scope

This epic is about improving the functionality and usability of the adaptive operation.

| In  | Out |

| Algorithm fixes to reliably generate toolpaths with small stepover                                                     | Refactoring operation code to turn adaptive into an area operation (this is organizational, not functional) |
| Improved automatic diameter selection for entry helix, to never fail if it is possible to enter at the chosen point    |  |
| Implement rest machining for adaptive                                                                                  |  |
