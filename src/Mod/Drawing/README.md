Development of the Drawing Workbench stopped in FreeCAD 0.16, and it became obsolete in FreeCAD 0.17, when the TechDraw Workbench was introduced.

The Drawing Workbench is no longer maintained. It is kept in the source tree for compatibility purposes, although there is no guarantee that it will continue working in future versions of FreeCAD. Eventually it may be removed completely.
