/** \addtogroup WORKBENCHES
    Most of FreeCAD's functionality is defined in dedicated Workbenches

    Those plugins, also called \b modules or \b workbenches, provide
    functionality for specialized facets of FreeCAD. The word \b module
    refers to any new group of tools, while \b workbench designates
    specifically a GUI group of tools in the FreeCAD interface. All
    workbenches are defined in modules, but not all modules contain a
    workbench. Practically, though, all the main modules define a
    workbench with the same name, so the terms are almost interchangeable.

    Some of these modules are programmed in C++, others in Python, and some
    in a mix of C++ and Python.
