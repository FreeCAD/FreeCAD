 *  Internal and external geometries are present in a single geometry vector one after the other.
 *
 * This class follows the format used by solver facade (sketch.cpp) in:
 * getSolvedSketch().extractGeometry() and by SketchObject in getCompleteGeometry(). Care should be
 * taken that the former may provide the list with a deep copy of the geometry pointers, whereas the
 * second just provides a shallow copy of the pointers.
 *
 * This class is templated to allow instantiations with list elements being legacy naked pointers
 * (Part::Geometry *) and GeometryFacade smart pointer objects. Convenience typedefs are provided:
 *
 * using GeoList = GeoListModel<GeometryPtr>;
 * using GeoListFacade = GeoListModel<GeometryFacadeUniquePtr>;
 *
 * with:
 * using GeometryPtr = Part::Geometry *;
 * using GeometryFacadeUniquePtr = std::unique_ptr<const Sketcher::GeometryFacade>;
 *
 * N.B.: Note that the index of the geomlist (all layers) and the GeoId can be converted
 * from each other as needed using the member functions (and sometimes the static functions).
