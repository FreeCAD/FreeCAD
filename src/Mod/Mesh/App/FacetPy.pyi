    Facet in mesh
    This is a facet in a MeshObject. You can get it by e.g. iterating a
    mesh. The facet has a connection to its mesh and allows therefore
    topological operations. It is also possible to create an unbounded facet e.g. to create
    a mesh. In this case the topological operations will fail. The same is
    when you cut the bound to the mesh by calling unbound().
