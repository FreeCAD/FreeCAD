  Description: >-
    MDF is an engineered wood product, composed of wood fibers and a binding resin,
    pressed together under high temperatures.
    The surface speeds given here are conservative values and can be increased up
    to 4x on capable machines with sufficiently large tools.
    In addition, the numbers here use the cutting force model from B.Ettelt,
    which is less accurate for smaller chip loads, but has the advantage of being
    compatible with the model from O.Kienzle commonly used for metals.
    Another source of uncertaintly is the unknown base rake angle.
    Overall, the numbers given here can only serve as an initial estimate.

    # provided is the upper bound of the given range 20..25.
    # Unfortunately, it is unknown with which rake angle the values have been obtained.
    # The choice of 20° is arbitrary and needs revision. It should prevent underestimation
    # of the calculated cutting force when expecting a value normalized for 0°.
    # i.e. 25 / (1 - 20/100) is 31.25
    # NB: Ettelt's model uses 'N/mm^1.5' because it does not normalizes the chip thickness,
    # however, the definition of FC's Machinability-model requires this normalization.
    UnitCuttingForce: '31.25 N/mm^2'
    # Ettelt's model uses the square root of the chip thickness, i.e. an 0.5 as exponent
