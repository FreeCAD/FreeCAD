    Description: >-
      Specific cutting force, normalized for a undeformed chip thickeness of 1 mm, a cutting
      width of 1 mm and a rake angle of 0 degrees.
      This material property, generally denoted with k_c1.1, is used together with a chip
      thickness exponent, m_c, to calculate the actual specific cutting force for the actual
      feed (i.e. undeformed chip thickness), the actual rake angle and other correction factors.
  ChipThicknessExponent:
    Type: 'Float'
    Units: None
    URL: 'https://www.machiningdoctor.com/glossary/specific-cutting-force-kc-kc1/'
    Description: >-
      This material property, also called "material constant" and generally denoted m_c,
      determines the effect of the undeformed chip thickness on the actual specific cutting
      force the further away it gets from the unit cutting force's normalization point.
