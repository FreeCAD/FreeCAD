    URL: 'https://www.machiningdoctor.com/glossary/specific-cutting-force-kc-kc1/'
    Description: >-
      Specific cutting force, normalized for a chip with cross section of 1 mm times 1 mm.
      This material property, generally denoted with k_c1.1, is used together with the
      "material constant" m_c to calculate the actual specific cutting force for the actual
      feed (i.e. undeformed chip thickness).
  MaterialConstant:
    Type: 'Float'
    Units: None
    URL: 'https://www.machiningdoctor.com/glossary/specific-cutting-force-kc-kc1/'
    Description: >-
      This material property, generally denoted m_c, determines the effect of the
      undeformed chip thickness on the actual specific cutting force, the further away
      it gets from k_c1.1's normalization point.
