    Description: >
      Defines the color of a surface that appears to emit as if it were a light
      source, independent of external lighting, making the object look
      self-illuminated. Set to black to have no emissive color.

    Type: 'Float'
    Units: ''
    URL: ''
    Description: >
      Defines the size and sharpness of specular highlights on a surface.
