# the reader and writer do not use some Library to read and write the ini file format
# they are implemented here
# thus non standard ini files will be read and written too
# in standard ini file format:
# a = in the value without any encapsulation or string quotes is not allowed (AFAIK)
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file
# http://www.docuxplorer.com/WebHelp/INI_File_Format.htm
# mainly this parser here is used in FreeCAD
# in the module Material.py is another implementation of reading and writing FCMat files
# the implementation in Material.py uses Pythons ConfigParser module
# in ViewProviderFemMaterial in add_cards_from_a_dir() the parser from Material.py is used
# since this mixture seems to have be there for ages it should not be changed for 0.18
# TODO and FIXME:
# get rid of this mixture
# best might be to switch to a more robust file schema like YAML
# as we had and we might will have problems again and again
