That directory contains set of scripts for FCMat<->ods conversion.
The main purpose of conversion FCMat<->ods is to allow batch editing as
it's much easier to edit a column in spreadsheet than 25 separate FCMat files.
Also creating new materials similar to an existing material is just
a matter of copying a row, changing file names and relevant properties.

Typical workflow:

1. Run ./make_ods.sh to create Materials.ods
2. Edit Materials.ods
4. Run ./make_FCMats.sh to create directory with new FCMat files
5. Copy edited FCMat files to StandardMaterials directory

Other scenarios:

A. Removing a property

1. Remove the property from headers file and from the TEMPLATE.FCMat file
2. Run ./make_ods.sh to create Materials.ods
3. Run ./make_FCMats.sh to create directory with new FCMat files
4. Copy FCMat files to StandardMaterials directory

B. Adding a property

1. Add the property to headers file and to the TEMPLATE.FCMat file with a description
2. Run ./make_ods.sh to create Materials.ods
3. Edit Materials.ods and fill the values of the new property (empty properties are not written to FCMat files)
3. Run ./make_FCMats.sh to create directory with new FCMat files
4. Copy FCMat files to StandardMaterials directory

C. Sorting properties as per header file order

2. Run ./make_ods.sh to create Materials.ods
3. Run ./make_FCMats.sh to create directory with new FCMat files
4. Copy FCMat files to StandardMaterials directory

Important comments:
1. First 5 lines of a FCMat file are copied without modification to the new FCMat file
2. The scripts are to be used only on linux, in the source code directory.
