"""Methods to verify if the python VTK module is the correct one

FreeCAD is linked with VTK libraries during its build process. To use the VTK
python module and pass objects between python and c++ the compiled module library
needs to be linked to the exact same vtk library as FreeCAD is. This is ensured by
installing VTK via linux app managers: All known distros install the python side
packages together with vtk libs. Libpack and other OS systems ensure this too.

However, if a vtk python package is installed manually, e.g. by "pip install vtk",
it could be found instead of the system module. This python API brings its own
set of VTK libs, and hence object passing in FreeCAD fails. (Note: import and
pure vtk python code still works, only passing to c++ fails)

This file provides functions that detect this situation and inform the user.
Additionally we try to find the correct module in the path and offer to use
it instead.

Note that this problem occurs with all "compiled binary" python APIs, also
with PySide. It is the users responsibility to handle his python path and keep
it clean/working. The functions provided here are a workaround only.
