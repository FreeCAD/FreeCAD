""" Query FEM specific settings including solver settings.

Query settings from the hierarchically organized settings/parameter system of
FreeCAD related to the FEM module. The collection of independent functions use
the settings system as a backend and expose a easy to use interface for other
modules of the FEM module.

Functions querying solver specific settings always take a solver name as a
string to identify the solver in question. At the moment the following solvers
are supported:

    - Calculix
    - ElmerSolver
    - Mystran
    - Z88

To query settings about those solver the solver name must be given exactly in
the form written in the list above. To make the solver recognize settings for a
new solver have a look at :class:`_SolverDlg`.
