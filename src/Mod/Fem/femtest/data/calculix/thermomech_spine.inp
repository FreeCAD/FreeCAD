**  About units:
**  See ccx manual, ccx does not know about any unit.
**  Golden rule: The user must make sure that the numbers they provide have consistent units.
**  The user is the FreeCAD calculix writer module ;-)
**
**  The unit system which is used at Guido Dhondt's company: mm, N, s, K
**  Since Length and Mass are connected by Force, if Length is mm the Mass is in t to get N
**  The following units are used to write to inp file:
**
**  Length: mm (this includes the mesh geometry)
**  Mass: t
**  TimeSpan: s
**  Temperature: K
**
**  This leads to:
**  Force: N
**  Pressure: N/mm^2 == MPa (Young's Modulus has unit Pressure)
**  Density: t/mm^3
**  Gravity: mm/s^2
**  Thermal conductivity: t*mm/K/s^3 == as W/m/K == kW/mm/K
**  Specific Heat: mm^2/s^2/K = J/kg/K == kJ/t/K
