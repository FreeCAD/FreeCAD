 *  A Analysis contains all objects necessary for a complete specification
 *  of a simulation. After computing it also contains the result of the
 *  simulation. The Analysis object is just a container. It is not responsible
 *  for anything else like executing the simulation.
 *
 *  The Analysis class is essentially a App::DocumentObjectGroup. It handles
 *  all the container stuff. The difference is that the Analysis document
 *  object uses a different ViewProvider, has a Uid property and does some
 *  compatibility handling via handleChangedPropertyName.
 *
 *  This implies that it is not checked which objects are put into the
 *  Analysis object. Every document object of FreeCAD can be part of a
 *  Analysis.
