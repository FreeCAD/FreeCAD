/**
 * @brief Base class of all Constraint Objects of the Fem module.
 *
 * @details
 *  @ref Constraint isn't intended to be used directly. Actual Constraints
 *  used to specify a simulation are children of this class. The base class
 *  essentially does two things: Most importantely it has a property @ref
 *  Constraint::References which is a list of all sub objects the constraint
 *  applies to. Defining it in the base class exposes a common interface to code
 *  using different constraints.
 *
 *  The second purpose of @ref Constraint is to support the redering to the
 *  screen done by the View Provider @ref FemGui::ViewProviderFemConstraint.
 *  The rendering is decoupled from the objects listed in the @ref References
 *  property by using a point cloud a normal vector and a scale factor which is
 *  generated by this class. The View Provider doesn't know of the references
 *  it just asks @ref Constraint for those values and renders a widget for each
 *  point scaled by the scale factor pointing in the direction of the normal
 *  vector. These values are exposed by the two properties @ref NormalDirection
 *  and @ref Scale and the protected method @ref getPoints(points&, normals&,
 *  scale&).
