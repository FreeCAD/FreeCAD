  <summary>An open source parametric 3D CAD modeler</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made 
      primarily to design real-life objects of any size. 
      Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your 
      design by going back into your model history and 
      changing its parameters. It is designed to fit a 
      wide range of uses including product design, mechanical 
      engineering, architecture and 3D printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      FreeCAD allows you to sketch geometry constrained 
      2D shapes and use them as a base to build other objects. 
      It contains many components to adjust dimensions or 
      extract design details from 3D models to create high 
      quality production-ready drawings. it is a multiplatfom 
      (Windows, Mac and Linux), highly customizable using the 
      Python language. It reads and writes to many open file 
      formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, 
      DAE and many others, making it possible to seamlessly 
      integrate it into your workflow. 
    </p>
    <p>
      FreeCAD includes a modern Finite Element Analysis (FEA) 
      tools, experimental CFD, BIM, Geodata workbenches, 
      a Path (CNC) workbench, a robot simulation module that 
      allows you to study robot movements and many more, and
      a rich collection of plugins and macros installable
      directly from within the application.
