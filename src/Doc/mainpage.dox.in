    \mainpage FreeCAD source documentation

    This is the source documentation of <a href=https://www.freecad.org>FreeCAD</a>. 
    It is automatically generated from the source code, and describes the different 
    components of the FreeCAD source code, for both the parts written in C++ and Python. 
    
    For general help and documentation about the FreeCAD application and how to use it, head
    first to the <a href=https://www.freecad.org/wiki>Wiki Documentation</a>.
    
    Refer to the
    <a href=https://www.freecad.org/wiki/The_FreeCAD_source_code>general 
    introduction to the FreeCAD source code</a> page for a broad view of how the source
    code is organized, and browse the modules, classes and namespaces from the menu above.
    
    The <a href=https://www.freecad.org/wiki/Developer_hub>Developers section</a>
    of the wiki also contains additional information for developers, and the 
    <a href=https://www.freecad.org/wiki/Power_users_hub>Powerusers / python scripting
    section</a> contains coding documentation that is specifically aimed at python scripting, but
    that will also be useful to C++ coders, as most of the APIs are identical or very similar.
    
    For space reasons, this on-line version doesn't include the source code headers nor the full
    inheritance graphics. But you can build a full version yourself with everything included, 
    as explained in <a href=https://freecad.org/wiki/Source_documentation>building
    the source code documentation</a>. You can also browse through the <a href=https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD>source
    code on github</a>.

    <b>Welcome to FreeCAD source documentation!</b>
    
    We hope you'll find it a convenient tool to explore, understand and
    experiment with the internals of the program.
    
    Being generated from the actual state of the code, this documentation
    is by no means a well structured corpus or a textbook, but more an
    utility to browse through the sources.
    
    If you seek information on FreeCAD at large, please consult our
    <a href="https://www.freecad.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki</a>
    
    FreeCAD being a fast moving target, don't hesitate to rebuild an up to
    date doc from source as often as needed (\ref makingdocs "more info"). CPU cycles are cheap
    nowadays! 
    
    The homepage of FreeCAD is <a href="https://www.freecad.org">here</a>.
