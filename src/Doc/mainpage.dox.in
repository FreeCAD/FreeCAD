    @section intro_main Introduction

    This is the source documentation of [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org).  It
    is automatically generated from the source code and describes the different
    components of the FreeCAD source code, for both the parts written in C++
    and Python.  The next section discusses the organization of this API
    documentation and the last section describes other forms of documentation
    that FreeCAD has.

    @section organization Organization of the API Documentation

    This documentation is divided into several topics of which the most important are:
    - @ref CORE "Core"
      - @ref BASE "Base"
      - @ref APP "App"
      - @ref GUI "Gui"
    - @ref WORKBENCHES "Workbenches"
    - @ref EMBEDDED "Embedded 3rd party packages"

    Firstly, topic @ref CORE "Core" contains the core namespaces and classes
    that all of FreeCAD relies on.  This consists of namespace %Base (see topic
    @ref BASE "Base") that contains fundamental base classes, the namespace
    %App (see topic @ref APP "App") that contains classes for FreeCAD in
    command-line mode, and namespace %Gui (see topic @ref GUI "Gui") that
    contains the classes for FreeCAD's GUI.

    FreeCAD is highly modular and most of its functionality is within modules
    that are called @ref WORKBENCHES "Workbenches".  Workbenches can be written
    in C++ or Python or in a combination of the two.  FreeCAD also has external
    workbenches that can be loaded from the Addon Manager.  These external
    workbenches need to be written in Python.

    Finally, there is the topic @ref EMBEDDED "Embedded 3rd party packages"
    that contains 3rd-party software of which the source is embedded in
    FreeCAD.  This means that during compilation, these packages will be
    compiled and linked to FreeCAD as opposed to non-embedded 3rd-party
    packages that are only linked to FreeCAD.  An example of an important
    non-embedded 3rd party software package is [Open CASCADE
    Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/).  Its API
    documentation can be found
    [here](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/index.html).

    @section other_doc Other Documentation

    For general help and documentation about the FreeCAD application and how to
    use it, head first to the [Wiki Documentation](https://www.freecad.org/wiki).

    Refer to the [Wiki page "The FreeCAD source
    code"](https://www.freecad.org/wiki/The_FreeCAD_source_code) for a broad
    view of how the source code is organized, and browse the modules, classes
    and namespaces from the menu above.

    The [Developer hub](https://www.freecad.org/wiki/Developer_hub) of the wiki
    contains additional information for developers and the [Power users /
    Python scripting section](https://www.freecad.org/wiki/Power_users_hub)
    contains coding documentation that is specifically aimed at Python
    scripting, but that will also be useful to C++ coders, as most of the APIs
    are identical or very similar.

    For space reasons, this on-line version doesn't include the source code
    headers nor the full inheritance graphics. But you can build a full version
    yourself with everything included, as explained in Wiki page [Source
    documentation](https://wiki.freecad.org/Source_documentation#Complete_documentation). You
    can also browse through the [source code on
    GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD).

    <b>Welcome to FreeCAD source documentation!</b>

    We hope you'll find it a convenient tool to explore, understand and
    experiment with the internals of the program.

    Being generated from the actual state of the code, this documentation
    is by no means a well structured corpus or a textbook, but more an
    utility to browse through the sources.

    If you seek information on FreeCAD at large, please consult our
    <a href="https://www.freecad.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki</a>

    FreeCAD being a fast moving target, don't hesitate to rebuild an up to
    date doc from source as often as needed (\ref makingdocs "more info"). CPU cycles are cheap
    nowadays!

    The homepage of FreeCAD is <a href="https://www.freecad.org">here</a>.
