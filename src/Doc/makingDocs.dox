/** \page makingdocs Building this source documentation

After running cmake (as per build instructions on the
<a href="http://freecad.org/wiki/Main_Page">FreeCAD wiki</a>,
run 'make DevDoc' in your build directory.  HTML documentation
will be built in doc/SourceDocu/html.

Tips:
 - If you have the "dot" tool from graphviz installed, before
   running cmake, you will get much nicer looking graphs in
   the source documentation.
