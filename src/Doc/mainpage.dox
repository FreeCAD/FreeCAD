  <b>Welcome to FreeCAD source documentation!</b>

  We hope you'll find it a convenient tool to explore, understand and
  experiment with the internals of the program.

  Being generated from the actual state of the code, this documentation
  is by no means a well structured corpus or a textbook, but more an
  utility to browse through the sources.

  If you seek informations on FreeCAD at large, please consult our
  <a href="http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Wiki</a>

  FreeCAD being a fast moving target, don't hesitate to rebuild an up to
  date doc from source as often as needed (\ref makingdocs "more info"). CPU cycles are cheap
  nowadays! 

  The homepage of FreeCAD is <a href="http://www.freecadweb.org">here</a>.
