 * values in a property "atomically", using possibly multiple primitive functions that normally would trigger
 * aboutToSetValue/hasSetValue calls on their own.
 *
 * To use, inherit privately from the AtomicPropertyChangeInterface class, using your class name as the template argument.
 * In all cases where you normally would call aboutToSetValue/hasSetValue before and after a change, create
 * an AtomicPropertyChange object before you do the change. Depending on a counter in the main property, the constructor might
 * invoke aboutToSetValue. When the AtomicPropertyChange object is destructed, it might call hasSetValue if it is found
 * necessary to do (i.e last item on the AtomicPropertyChange stack). This makes it easy to match the calls, and it is also
 * exception safe in the sense that the destructors are guaranteed to be called during unwinding and exception
 * handling, making the calls to boutToSetValue and hasSetValue balanced.
