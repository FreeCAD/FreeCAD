""" Script to run FreeCADs python unit tests.

This script is designed to run in internal mode inside of FreeCAD. It purpose
is to execute FreeCADs unit tests easily accessible directly from the command
line and it is also capable of collecting and reporting test coverage
information. This script is necessary because FreeCADs unit tests must be
executed inside the embedded python iterpreter. The standard way of invoking
python unit tests directly via the unittest module cannot provide this.

This script is executed after FreeCAD has started and than executes the tests.
To use the script use the -t and optionally the --cov arguments when invoking
the FreeCAD or FreeCADGui binary. The -t <test> option specifies the unit
test(s) to execute. It can be a module, test class, test function or a
specifically prepared package representing an abitrary collection of tests.

To get a test coverage report use the --cov [<source>] option. The optional
[<source>] option can be used to specify which source files shall be measured
and must be a valid python path to a package or a module if used. The
previously mentioned specifically prepared packages define their sources
themselfs so the <source> option doesn't have to be used to optain a clean
report. With that said it still can be used to override the source definition
of the package.

A package defining a test collection must define two methods:

.. code-block:: python

   def load_tests(loader, tests, pattern):
       return <unittest.TestSuite>

   def cover_tests():
       return <[string]>

The first method (load_tests) returns a test suite in accordence to the
load_test protocoll of the unittest module. cover_tests is a FreeCAD specific
extension defining which modules or packages the collection of tests is
supposted to cover/test. This information is used to produce a meaningful
test coverage report.
