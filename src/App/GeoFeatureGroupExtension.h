/**
 * @brief The base class for placeable group of DocumentObjects. It represents a local coordnate system
 * 
 * This class is the FreeCAD way of representing local coordinate systems. It groups its children beneath 
 * it and transforms them all with the GeoFeatureGroup placement. A few important properties:
 * - Every child that belongs to the CS must be in the Group property. Even if a sketch is part of a pad,
 *   it must be in the Group property of the same GeoFeatureGroup as pad. This also holds for normal 
 *   GroupExtensions. They can be added to a GeoFeatureGroup, but all objects that the group holds must 
 *   also be added to the GeoFeatureGroup
 * - Objects can be only in a single GeoFeatureGroup. It is not allowed to have a document object in 
 *   multiple GeoFeatureGroups
 * - PropertyLinks between different GeoFeatureGroups are forbidden. There are special link properties 
 *   that allow such cross-CS links.
 * - Expressions can cross GeoFeatureGroup borders
