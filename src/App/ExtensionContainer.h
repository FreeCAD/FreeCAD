/**
 * @brief A container that can hold extensions.
 *
 * The concept of extensions provides a way to extend the functionality of
 * objects in FreeCAD despite Python's limitations with multiple inheritance
 * (see below for an explanation).  Extensions are FreeCAD objects that act
 * like regular objects in the sense that they have properties and class
 * methods to define their functionality.  However, extensions are not exposed
 * as individual usable entities but are used to extend other objects.  An
 * extended object obtains all the properties and methods of the extension.
 *
 * As such, it is like C++ multiple inheritance, which is indeed used to
 * achieve this on C++ side, but it provides a few important additional
 * functionalities as well:
 *
 * - Property persistence is handled: save and restore work out of the box.
 * - The objects Python API gets extended too with the extension Python API.
 * - Extensions can be added from C++ and Python, even from both together.
 *
 * The interoperability with Python is highly important since in FreeCAD, all
 * functionality should be easily accessible from both Python and C++.  To
 * ensure this -- as already noted -- extensions can be added to an object from
 * Python.
 *
 * However, this means that it is not clear from the C++ object type whether an
 * extension was added or not:  If added from C++, it becomes clear in the type
 * due to the use of multiple inheritance.  If added from Python, it is a
 * runtime extension and not visible from the type.  Hence, querying existing
 * extensions of an object and accessing its methods works not by type casting
 * but by the interface provided in ExtensionContainer.  The default workflow
 * is to query whether an extension exists and then to get the extension
 * object.  This interface always works the same, no matter if added from
 * Python or C++.
 *
 * @code
 * if (object->hasExtension(GroupExtension::getClassTypeId())) {
 *     App::GroupExtension* group = object->getExtensionByType<GroupExtension>();
 *     group->hasObject(...);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To add a extension to an object, it must comply to a single restriction: it
 * must be derived from ExtensionContainer.  This is important to allow adding
 * extensions from Python and also to access the universal extension API. As
 * DocumentObject itself derives from ExtensionContainer, this should be the
 * case automatically in most circumstances.
 *
 * Note that two small boilerplate changes are needed in addition to the
 * multiple inheritance when adding extensions from C++.
 *
 * 1. It must be ensured that the property and type registration is aware of the extensions by using
 *    special macros.
 * 2. The extensions need to be initialised in the constructor.
 *
 * Here is a working example:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * class AppExport Part : public App::DocumentObject
 *                      , public App::FirstExtension
 *                      , public App::SecondExtension
 * {
 *     PROPERTY_HEADER_WITH_EXTENSIONS(App::Part);
 * };
 *
 * PROPERTY_SOURCE_WITH_EXTENSIONS(App::Part, App::DocumentObject)
 *
 * Part::Part(void)
 * {
 *   FirstExtension::initExtension(this);
 *   SecondExtension::initExtension(this);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * From Python, adding an extension is easier: It must be simply registered to
 * a document object at object initialisation like done with properties.  Note
 * that the special Python extension objects need to be added, not the C++
 * objects.  Normally the only difference in name is the additional "Python" at
 * the end of the extension name.
 *
 * @code{.py}
 * class Test():
 *   __init(self)__:
 *     registerExtension("App::FirstExtensionPython", self)
 *     registerExtension("App::SecondExtensionPython", self)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Extensions can provide methods that should be overridden by the extended
 * object for customisation of the extension behaviour. In C++ this is as
 * simple as overriding the provided virtual functions. In Python a class
 * method must be provided which has the same name as the method to override.
 * This method must not necessarily be in the object that is extended, it must
 * be in the object which is provided to the "registerExtension" call as second
 * argument.  This second argument is used as a proxy and queried if the method
 * to override exists in this proxy before calling it.
 *
 * For information on how to create extension see the documentation of
 * Extension.
 *
 * @section Limitations of Python
 *
 * Without this extension system, it would be challenging to use extending
 * functionality in FreeCAD.  Although C++ supports multiple inheritance, it is
 * not possible to use it in FreeCAD because it should be possible to expose
 * all objects to Python.
 *
 * However, using multiple parent classes in Python is currently not possible
 * with the default object approach.  Moreover, it is basically impossible to
 * handle multiple inheritance in the C-API for Python extensions.
