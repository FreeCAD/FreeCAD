/**
 * @brief Container which can hold extensions
 *
 * In FreeCAD normally inheritance is a chain, it is not possible to use multiple inheritance.
 * The reason for this is that all objects need to be exposed to python, and it is basically
 * impossible to handle multiple inheritance in the C-API for python extensions. Also using multiple
 * parent classes in python is currently not possible with the default object approach.
 *
 * The concept of extensions allow to circumvent those problems. Extensions are FreeCAD objects
 * which work like normal objects in the sense that they use properties and class methods to define
 * their functionality. However, they are not exposed as individual usable entities but are used to
 * extend other objects. A extended object gets all the properties and methods of the extension.
 * Therefore it is like c++ multiple inheritance, which is indeed used to achieve this on c++ side,
 * but provides a few important additional functionalities:
 * - Property persistence is handled, save and restore work out of the box
 * - The objects python API gets extended too with the extension python API
 * - Extensions can be added from c++ and python, even from both together
 *
 * The interoperability with python is highly important, as in FreeCAD all functionality should be
 * as easily accessible from python as from c++. To ensure this, and as already noted, extensions can
 * be added to a object from python. However, this means that it is not clear from the c++ object type
 * if an extension was added or not. If added from c++ it becomes clear in the type due to the use of
 * multiple inheritance. If added from python it is a runtime extension and not visible from type.
 * Hence querying existing extensions of an object and accessing its methods works not by type
 * casting but by the interface provided in ExtensionContainer. The default workflow is to query if
 * an extension exists and then get the extension object. No matter if added from python or c++ this
 * interface works always the same.
 * @code
 * if (object->hasExtension(GroupExtension::getClassTypeId())) {
 *     App::GroupExtension* group = object->getExtensionByType<GroupExtension>();
 *     group->hasObject(...);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To add a extension to an object, it must comply to a single restriction: it must be derived
 * from ExtensionContainer. This is important to allow adding extensions from python and also to
 * access the universal extension API. As DocumentObject itself derives from ExtensionContainer this
 * should be the case automatically in most circumstances.
 *
 * Note that two small boilerplate changes are needed next to the multiple inheritance when adding
 * extensions from c++.
 * 1. It must be ensured that the property and type registration is aware of the extensions by using
 *    special macros.
 * 2. The extensions need to be initialised in the constructor
 *
 * Here is a working example:
 * @code
 * class AppExport Part : public App::DocumentObject, public App::FirstExtension, public App::SecondExtension {
 *   PROPERTY_HEADER_WITH_EXTENSIONS(App::Part);
 * };
 * PROPERTY_SOURCE_WITH_EXTENSIONS(App::Part, App::DocumentObject)
 * Part::Part(void) {
 *   FirstExtension::initExtension(this);
 *   SecondExtension::initExtension(this);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * From python adding an extension is easier, it must be simply registered to a document object
 * at object initialisation like done with properties. Note that the special python extension objects
 * need to be added, not the c++ objects. Normally the only difference in name is the additional
 * "Python" at the end of the extension name.
 * @code{.py}
 * class Test():
 *   __init(self)__:
 *     registerExtension("App::FirstExtensionPython", self)
 *     registerExtension("App::SecondExtensionPython", self)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Extensions can provide methods that should be overridden by the extended object for customisation
 * of the extension behaviour. In c++ this is as simple as overriding the provided virtual functions.
 * In python a class method must be provided which has the same name as the method to override. This
 * method must not necessarily be in the object that is extended, it must be in the object which is
 * provided to the "registerExtension" call as second argument. This second argument is used as a
 * proxy and enqueired if the method to override exists in this proxy before calling it.
 *
