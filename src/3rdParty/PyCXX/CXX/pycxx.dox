   \brief C++ facilities to make it easier to write Python extensions

   CXX/Objects is a set of C++ facilities to make it easier to write 
   Python extensions. The chief way in which PyCXX makes it easier to 
   write Python extensions is that it greatly increases the probability 
   that your program will not make a reference-counting error and will 
   not have to continually check error returns from the Python C API. 
   CXX/Objects integrates Python with C++ in these ways:

   C++ exception handling is relied on to detect errors and clean up. 
   In a complicated function this is often a tremendous problem when 
   writing in C. With PyCXX, we let the compiler keep track of what 
   objects need to be dereferenced when an error occurs.
   The Standard Template Library (STL) and its many algorithms plug and 
   play with Python containers such as lists and tuples.
   The optional CXX/Extensions facility allows you to replace the 
   clumsy C tables with objects and method calls that define your 
   modules and extension objects.

   PyCXX documentation is split into <a 
   HREF="http://cxx.sourceforge.net/PyCXX-Python3.html">Python 3</A> and 
   <A HREF="http://cxx.sourceforge.net/PyCXX-Python2.html">Python 2</A> 
   versions. The Python 3 documentation is the most accurate.
