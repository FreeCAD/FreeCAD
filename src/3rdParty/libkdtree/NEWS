libkdtree++ NEWS
================

17 Nov 2008:
   Again, it's almost Christmas. Recently a whole lot of bug have been fixed in
   version 0.6.3 of the library. You can find a summary of the fixes in the
   Changelog. For short:
   - you can now assign an existing tree to another tree without an ugly bug if
   your tree required parameters for the accessor,
   - now you can finally use the reverse iterator,
   - find() and erase() work properly based on the location given in argument,
   - the project is compatible with MSVC2005
   - many more...

   It's Christmas, and libkdtree++ packs in more power for the find
   and find_nearest functions. Performance improvement should be
   carried on with other part of the interface in the coming months.

   As a result of these modification, KDTree definition has been a
   little altered. The new definition includes a template for a
   distance calculator. This functor by default calcultes the square
   of th difference between two elements returned by the accessor.

   Sylvain Bougerel spent some time cleaning up the code and build
   infrastructure of the code from Sourceforge, and I imported the
   results of his work to a git repository on git.debian.org today.
