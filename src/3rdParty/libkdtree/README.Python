Stand-alone Python bindings, contributed by Willi Richert <w.richert@gmx.net>

To make them:
$ cd python-bindings 
$ make
You will find then two files kdtree.py _kdtree.so in the current directory.
These are all you need to use libkdtree++.
Please examine the test files to get a grip to the usage.

To run the tests, type:
python py-kdtree_test.py
