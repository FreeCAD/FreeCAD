The CxImage is only used for a Windows thumbnailer. The utility
"ThumbnailProvider" is a DLL which can be registered to Windows as a so called
shell extension.  This utility is able to create a preview image of an FCStd
project file and CxImage is needed to convert the data into a format that
Windows expects.
