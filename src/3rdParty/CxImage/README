The CxImage is only used for a Windows thumbnailer. The utility
"ThumbnailProvider" is a DLL which can be registered to Windows as a so called
shell extension.  This utility is able to create a preview image of an FCStd
project file and CxImage is needed to convert the data into a format that
Windows expects.

The format Windows accepts is a BITMAP handle for which Qt could also be used.
But this requires a dependency of two rather heavy DLLs (QtCore, QtGui) and
with a statically linked CxImage we don't have this problem.
