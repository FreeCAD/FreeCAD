  \class SoTextureCoordinateFunction SoTextureCoordinateFunction.h Inventor/nodes/SoTextureCoordinateFunction.h
  \brief The SoTextureCoordinateFunction class is an abstract base class for texture coordinate generating nodes.

  \ingroup coin_nodes

  Classes reimplementing SoTextureCoordinateFunction generate texture coordinates
  by projecting object space surface points using some function.
