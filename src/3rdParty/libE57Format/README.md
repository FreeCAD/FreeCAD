[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/asmaloney/libE57Format)](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/releases/latest) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-online-orange)](https://asmaloney.github.io/libE57Format-docs/) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/asmaloney/libE57Format)](LICENSE) ![Build](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

libE57Format is a C++ library which provides read & write support for the ASTM-standard [E57 file format](https://www.astm.org/e2807-11r19e01.html) on Linux, macOS, and Windows. E57 files store 3D point cloud data (produced by 3D imaging systems such as laser scanners), attributes associated with 3D point data (color & intensity), and 2D images (photos taken using a 3D imaging system).

## Documentation

The doxygen-generated documentation may be [found here](https://asmaloney.github.io/libE57Format-docs/). These docs are generated and saved in the [libE57Format-docs](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format-docs) repo.

## Dependencies/Requirements

Tools:

- a [C++14](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/14) compatible compiler
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.15
- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for code formatting
- (_optional_) [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) to speed up rebuilds

Libraries:

- [Xerces-C++](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/) (for parsing XML)

### Installing Dependencies On Linux (Ubuntu)

```sh
$ sudo apt install libxerces-c-dev clang-format
```

### Installing Dependencies On macOS (homebrew)

```sh
$ brew install ccache clang-format xerces-c
```

## Build, Install, & Test

Here's how you build & install a release version with the defaults:

```
$ cmake -B E57-build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=E57-install libE57Format
$ cmake --build E57-build --parallel
$ cmake --install E57-build
```

If CMake can't find the xerces-c library, you can set [CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html) to point at it.

```
$ cmake -B E57-build \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=E57-install \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/xerces-c \
    libE57Format
```

Once the library is built, you can run the tests like this:

```
$ cd E57-build
$ ./test/testE57
[==========] Running 36 tests from 8 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from TestData
[ RUN      ] TestData.RepoExists
...
```

See [test/README](test/README.md) for details about testing and the test data.

## üç¥ Fork

This is a fork of [E57RefImpl](https://sourceforge.net/projects/e57-3d-imgfmt/). The original source is from [E57RefImpl 1.1.332](https://sourceforge.net/projects/e57-3d-imgfmt/files/E57Refimpl-src/).

The original code had not been touched in years and I wanted to make changes to compile it on macOS. Forking it gave me a bit more freedom to update the code and make changes as required. Everything was stripped out except the main implementation for reading & writing E57 files.

Notes:

- I changed the name of the project so that it is not confused with the **E57RefImpl** project.
- I changed the main include file's name from `E57Foundation.h` to `E57Format.h` to make sure there is no inclusion confusion.
- Versions of **libE57Format** started at 2.0.
- I made changes for it to compile and run on macOS.
- It no longer depends on [Boost](http://www.boost.org/).
- It now requires [C++14](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/14). (Version 2.x required [C++11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/11).)

Many, many other changes were made prior to the first release of this fork. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and git history for details.

### E57Simple API

[Jiri H√∂rner](https://github.com/ptc-jhoerner) added the E57Simple API from the old reference implementation and updated it.

This _Simple API_ has evolved since this original port to fix some problems and to make it more foolproof & easier to use. Please see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for version 3.

### Tools

[Ryan Baumann](https://github.com/ryanfb) updated the `e57unpack` and `e57validate` tools to work with **libE57Format**. You can find them in the [e57tools](https://github.com/ryanfb/e57tools) repo.

## Projects Using libE57Format

- [CloudCompare](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare)
- [MeshLab](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab)
- [pye57](https://github.com/davidcaron/pye57)

These projects use hard forks of libE57Format:

- [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD)

If you found this project useful, please consider starring it! It helps me gauge how useful this project is.

### ‚òù Raise Issues

If you run into something which doesn't work as expected, raising [an issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/issues) with all the relevant information to reproduce it would be helpful.

### üêû Bug Fixes & üß™ New Things

I am happy to review any [pull requests](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/pulls). Please keep them as short as possible. Each pull request should be atomic and only address one issue. This helps with the review process.

Note that I will not accept everything, but I welcome discussion. If you are proposing a big change, please raise it as [an issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/issues) first for discussion.

#### Formatting

This project uses [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the code. There is a cmake target (_e57-clang-format_) - which runs _clang-format_ on the source files. After changes have been made, and before you submit your pull request, please run the following:

```sh
cmake --build . --target e57-clang-format
```

### üìñ Documentation

The [documentation](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format) is a bit old and could use some lovin'. You can submit changes over in the [libE57Format-docs](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format-docs) repository.

### üí∞ Financial

Given that I'm an independent developer without funding, financial support is always appreciated. If you would like to support the project financially (especially if you sell a product which uses this library), you can use the [sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/asmaloney) for one-off or recurring support. Thank you!
