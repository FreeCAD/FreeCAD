     * save itself. In this cases it is possible to write the data in a separate file
     * inside the document archive. In case you want do so you have to re-implement
     * SaveDocFile(). First, you have to inform the framework in Save() that you want do so.
     * Here an example from the Mesh module which can save a (pontetionaly big) triangle mesh:
     * \code
     * void PropertyMeshKernel::Save (Base::Writer &writer) const

     * The writer.isForceXML() is an indication to force you to write XML. Regardless of size and effectiveness.
     * The second part informs the Base::writer through writer.addFile("MeshKernel.bms", this) that this object
     * wants to write a file with the given name. The method addFile() returns a unique name that then is written
     * in the XML stream.
     * This allows your RestoreDocFile() method to identify and read the file again.
     * Later your SaveDocFile() method is called as many times as you issued the addFile() call:
     * \code
     * void PropertyMeshKernel::SaveDocFile (Base::Writer &writer) const
     * {
     *     _pcMesh->Write( writer );
     * }

     * In this method you can simply stream your content to the file (Base::Writer inheriting from ostream).
