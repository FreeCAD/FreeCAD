/** The PyHandler class
 *  This class is the base class of all FreeCAD classes
 *  which exports into the python space. This class handles the
 *  creation referencing of the python export object.
 *
 *  @remark GetPyObject() returns the associated Python object to any C++ subclasses. As we cannot
 *  determine for sure if we can increment the returned Python object from outside of GetPyObject()
 *  we have specified that GetPyObject() does already the increment of the reference counter
 *  if needed.
 *
 *  E.g. if GetPyObject() always returns a new Python object then no increment is necessary,
 *  because at construction time the reference counter is already set to 1. If the Python
 *  interpreter stores this object pointer into a local variable and destroys this variable
 *  then the reference counter gets decremented (to 0) and the object gets destroyed automatically.
 *  In case we didn't make this specification and increment the Python object from outside once again then
 *  the reference counter would be set to 2 and there would be no chance to destroy the object again.
 *
 *  The other case is that we have a member variable in our C++ class that holds the Python object
 *  then we either can create this Python in the constructor or create it the first  time when GetPyObject()
 *  gets called. In the destructor then we must decrement the Python object to avoid a memory leak while
 *  GetPyObject() then increments the Python object every time it gets called.
 *
 *  @remark One big consequence of this specification is that the programmer must know whether the Python interpreter
 *  gets the Python object or not. If the interpreter gets the object then it decrements the counter later on when
 *  the internal variable is freed. In case the interpreter doesn't get this object then the programmer must do the
 *  decrement on his own.
 *
 *  @note To not to undermine this specification the programmer must make sure to get the Python object always via
 *  GetPyObject().
 *

/** Python Object handle class
 *  Using pointers on classes derived from PyObjectBase would
 *  be potentionaly dangerous because you would have to take
 *  care of the reference counting of python by your self. Hence
 *  this class was designed. It takes care of references and
 *  as long as a object of this class exists the handled class get
 *  not destructed. That means a PyObjectBase derived object you can
 *  only destruct by destructing all FCPyHandle and all python
 *  references on it!
