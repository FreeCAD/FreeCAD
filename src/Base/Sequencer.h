/**
 * \brief This class gives the user an indication of the progress of an operation and
 * it is used to reassure him that the application is still running.
 *
 * Here are some code snippets of how to use the sequencer:
 *  \code
 *
 *  #include <Base/Sequencer.h>
 *
 *  //first example
 *  Base::SequencerLauncher seq("my text", 10)
 *  for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
 *  {
 *    // do something
 *    seq.next ();
 *  }
 *
 *  //second example
 *  Base::SequencerLauncher seq("my text", 10)
 *  do
 *  {
 *    // do something
 *  }
 *  while (seq.next());
 *
 *  \endcode
 *
 * The implementation of this class also supports several nested instances
 * at a time. But note, that only the first instance has an effect. Any further
 * sequencer instance doesn't influence the total number of iteration steps. This
 * is simply because it's impossible to get the exact number of iteration steps
 * for nested instances and thus we have either too few steps estimated then the
 * sequencer may indicate 100% but the algorithm still running or we have too many
 * steps estimated so that the an algorithm may stop long before the sequencer
 * reaches 100%.
 *
 *  \code
 *  try {
 *    //start the first operation
 *    Base::SequencerLauncher seq1("my text", 10)
 *    for (int i=0; i<10, i++)
 *    {
 *      // do something
 *
 *      // start the second operation while the first one is still running
 *      Base::SequencerLauncher seq2("another text", 10);
 *      for (int j=0; j<10; j++)
 *      {
 *        // do something different
 *        seq2.next ();
 *      }
 *
 *      seq1.next ( true ); // allow to cancel
 *    }
 *  }
 *  catch(const Base::AbortException&){
 *    // cleanup your data if needed
 *  }
 *
 *  \endcode
 *
 * \note If using the sequencer with SequencerLauncher.next(\a true) then you must
 * take into account that the exception \a AbortException could be thrown, e.g. in
 * case the ESC button was pressed. So in this case it's always a good idea to use
 * the sequencer within a try-catch block.
 *
 * \note Instances of SequencerLauncher should always be created on the stack.
 * This is because if an exception somewhere is thrown the destructor is auto-
 * matically called to clean-up internal data.
 *
 * \note It's not supported to create an instance of SequencerBase or a sub-class
 * in another thread than the main thread. But you can create SequencerLauncher
 * instances in other threads.

/** The SequencerLauncher class is provided for convenience. It allows you to run an instance of the
 * sequencer by instantiating an object of this class -- most suitable on the stack. So this mechanism
 * can be used for try-catch-blocks to destroy the object automatically if the C++ exception mechanism
 * cleans up the stack.
 *
 * This class has been introduced to simplify the use with the sequencer. In the FreeCAD Gui layer there
 * is a subclass of SequencerBase called ProgressBar that grabs the keyboard and filters most of the incoming
 * events. If the programmer uses the API of SequencerBase directly to start an instance without due diligence
 * with exceptions then a not handled exception could block the whole application -- the user has to kill the
 * application then.
 *
 * Below is an example of a not correctly used sequencer.
 *
 * \code
 *
 *  #include <Base/Sequencer.h>
 *
 *  void runOperation();
 *
 *  void myTest()
 *  {
 *    try{
 *       runOperation();
 *    } catch(...) {
 *       // the programmer forgot to stop the sequencer here
 *       // Under circumstances the sequencer never gets stopped so the keyboard never gets ungrabbed and
 *       // all Gui events still gets filtered.
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 *  void runOperation()
 *  {
 *    Base::Sequencer().start ("my text", 10);
 *
 *    for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
 *    {
 *      // do something where an exception be thrown
 *      ...
 *      Base::Sequencer().next ();
 *    }
 *
 *    Base::Sequencer().stop ();
 *  }
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * To avoid such problems the SequencerLauncher class can be used as follows:
 *
 * \code
 *
 *  #include <Base/Sequencer.h>
 *
 *  void runOperation();
 *
 *  void myTest()
 *  {
 *    try{
 *       runOperation();
 *    } catch(...) {
 *       // the programmer forgot to halt the sequencer here
 *       // If SequencerLauncher leaves its scope the object gets destructed automatically and
 *       // stops the running sequencer.
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 *  void runOperation()
 *  {
 *    // create an instance on the stack (not on any terms on the heap)
 *    SequencerLauncher seq("my text", 10);
 *
 *    for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
 *    {
 *      // do something (e.g. here can be thrown an exception)
 *      ...
 *      seq.next ();
 *    }
 *  }
 *
