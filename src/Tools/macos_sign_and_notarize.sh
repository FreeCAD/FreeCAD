# This script signs and notarizes a FreeCAD.app bundle. It expects that the bundle is in a folder
# by itself (that folder will be used as the basis for the created disk image file, so anything
# else in it will become part of the image). That folder should be located in the same folder as
# this script.

# An environment variable called FREECAD_SIGNING_KEY_ID must exist that contains the ID of a
# Developer ID Application certificate that has been installed into the login keychain. See the
# output of
#   security find-identity -p basic -v
# for a list of available keys, and the documentation for
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials
# for instructions on how to configure the credentials for the tool for use before running this
# script.

# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
CONTAINING_FOLDER="FreeCAD_0.21.1_arm64" # Must contain FreeCAD.app and nothing else
ARCH="arm64" # intel_x86 or arm64
VERSION_MAJOR="0"
VERSION_MINOR="21"
VERSION_PATCH="1"
VERSION_SUFFIX="" # e.g. alpha, beta, RC1, RC2, release
