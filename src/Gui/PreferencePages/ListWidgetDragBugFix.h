 /* Qt has a recent bug (2023, https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-100128)
 * where the items disappears in certain conditions when drag and dropping.
 * Here we prevent the situation where this happens.
 * 1 - If the item is dropped on the item below such that the item doesn't move (ie superior half of the below item)
 * 2 - The item is the last one and user drop it on the empty space below.
 * In both those cases the item widget was lost.
 * When Qt solve this bug, this class should not be required anymore.
