    data block.  BackBuffer is a vector< unsigned char > that fills
    itself with data from a file by reading chunks from the end of the
    file progressing towards the start. Upon construction the
    BackBuffer instance is associated with a file and a chunksize can
    be specified. To read a chunk of the file into the BackBuffer call
    readChunk(). */
