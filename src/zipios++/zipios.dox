   \section intro Introduction
   
   Zipios++ is a java.util.zip-like C++ library for reading and
   writing Zip files. Access to individual entries is provided through
   standard C++ iostreams. A simple read-only virtual file system that
   mounts regular directories and zip files is also provided.
   
   The source code is released under the <A
   HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
   License</A>.
   
   \section status Status

   \subsection zipfiles Zip file access
   The two most important classes are \ref zipfile_anchor "ZipFile" and 
   \ref ZipInputStream_anchor "ZipInputStream". ZipInputStream is an istream
   for reading zipfiles. It can be instantiated directly, without the
   use of ZipFile. A new ZipInputStream reads from the first entry, and
   the user can skip to the next entry by calling
   \ref ZipInputStream_getnextentry_anchor "ZipInputStream::getNextEntry()".
   
   ZipFile scans the central directory of a zipfile and provides an
   interface to access that directory. The user may search for entries
   with a particular filename using \ref fcoll_getentry_anchor "ZipFile::getEntry()", 
   or simply get the complete list of entries
   with \ref fcoll_entries_anchor "ZipFile::entries()". To get an
   istream (ZipInputStream) to a particular entry simply use
   \ref fcoll_getinputstream "ZipFile::getInputStream()".
   
   "example_zip.cpp" demonstrates the central elements of Zipios++.
   
   A Zip file appended to another file, e.g. a binary program, with the 
   program "appendzip", can be read with 
   \ref zipfile_openembeddedzipfile "ZipFile::openEmbeddedZipFile()".

   \subsection filecollections FileCollections
   
   A ZipFile is actually just a special kind of 
   \ref fcoll_anchor "FileCollection" that
   obtains its entries from a .zip Zip archive. Zipios++ also implements
   a \ref dircol_anchor "DirectoryCollection" that obtains its entries 
   from a specified directory, and a \ref collcoll_anchor "CollectionCollection" 
   that obtains its entries from
   other collections. Using a single CollectionCollection any number of
   other FileCollections can be placed under its control and accessed
   through the same single interface that is used to access a ZipFile or
   a DirectoryCollection. A singleton (a unique global instance)
   CollectionCollection can be obtained through
   
   \ref collcoll_inst_anchor "CollectionCollection::inst()" ;

   To save typing CollectionCollection has been typedef'ed to CColl. In
   the initialization part of an application FileCollections can be
   created, and placed under CColll::inst()'s control using
   
   \ref collcoll_addcoll_anchor "CColl::inst().addCollection()"
   
   and later an istream can be obtained using

   \ref fcoll_getinputstream "CColl::inst().getInputStream()".
