This is the FreeCAD standard material library. It's intended to gather
the most common Material definitions.
How to do a description is explained here:
http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Material

To make the material description useful for a lot of applications only
files with the (CC BY 3.0) license will be accepted into the FreeCAD
source distribution. For more detail about the license, see here:

Please help!
Enlargen the base of Materials for FreeCAD will greatly benefit the
usability of FreeCAD. So please help us to add new Materials, review
existing ones or add additional values. A good source for material
definitions are textbooks or the www.matweb.com database.
