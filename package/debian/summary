FreeCAD is a free and open-source general-purpose parametric 3D computer-aided design modeler and a building information modeling software with finite element method support.
FreeCAD is intended for mechanical engineering product design but also expands to a wider range of uses around engineering, such as architecture or electrical engineering.
It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability to run as a server and dynamically loadable application extensions and it is designed to be platform independent.
