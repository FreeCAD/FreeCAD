Title: FreeCAD development documentation
Author: FreeCAD developers
Abstract: FreeCAD is a general purpose Open Source 3D 
 CAD/MCAD/CAx/CAE/PLM modeler, aimed directly at mechanical engineering 
 and product design but also fits in a wider range of uses around 
 engineering, such as architecture or other engineering specialties. 
 It is a feature-based parametric modeler with a modular software 
 architecture which makes it easy to provide additional functionality 
 without modifying the core system.
