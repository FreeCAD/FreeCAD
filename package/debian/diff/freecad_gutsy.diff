+.SH NAME
+freecad \- An extensible Open Source CAx program for Unix/X11
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B freecad
+.RI [ options ] " files"
+.br
+.B freecadcmd
+.RI [ options ] " files"
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B FreeCAD
+is an Open Source CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python. It features 
+some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability to run as a 
+server and dynamically loadable application extensions and it is designed 
+to be platform independent.
+.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
+.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
+.\" respectively.
+.SH USAGE
+\fBfreecad\fR starts with a GUI while \fBfreecadcmd\fR is only a pure command line version that starts a Python interpreter.
+.SH OPTIONS
+These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
+options starting with two dashes (`-').
+A summary of the options supported by \fBfreecad\fR is included below.
+.SS "Generic options"
+.TP
+\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
+Show summary of options.
+.TP
+\fB\-v, \-\-version\fR
+Show version of program.
+.TP
+\fB\-c, \-\-console\fR
+Start in console mode.
+.TP
+\fB\-\-response\-file\fR \fIarg\fR
+Can be specified with '@name', too.
+
+.SS "Configuration"
+.TP
+\fB\-l, \-\-write\-log\fR

+Description: An extensible Open Source CAx program (alpha)
+ FreeCAD is an Open Source CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python.
+ It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability
+ to run as a server and dynamically loadable application extensions and
+ it is designed to be platform independent.
+ .
+ Currently, FreeCAD can import and display CAD models in IGES, STEP, and
+ BRep formats and meshes in STL, BMS, AST and Wavefront OBJ formats.
+ Editing and modeling features are currently somewhat limited.

+.SH NAME
+freecad-thumbnailer \- A thumbnailer for FreeCAD project files
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+\fBfreecad-thumbnailer\fP [ -s \fIsize\fP ] \fIinput file\fP \fIoutput file\fP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBfreecad-thumbnailer\fP
+is a Python script that extracts an embedded thumbnail from a FreeCAD project file.
+If no thumbnail is embedded then nothing happens. According to the specification of
+freedesktop.org the thumbnail image is a PNG file. The required \fBinput file\fP argument
+specifies the project file where the thumbnail should be extracted from and the 
+\fBoutput file\fP specifies the file where the thumbnail should be written to.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+\fB-s \fIsize\fR
+Specify the size of the image in pixel.
