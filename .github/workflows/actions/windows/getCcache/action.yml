# This action aims at speeding up CI and reduce dependency to external resources
# by creating a cache of Ccache needed binaries then using it for CI runs rather
# than downloading every time.
#
# If it needs to be updated to another version, the process it to change
# 'downloadpath' and 'version' inputs below then delete the existing cache
# from Github interface so a new one is generated using new values.
