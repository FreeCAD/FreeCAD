Overview
--------

* **Freedom to build what you want:**
with integrated tools for part design, analysis, documentation, assembly, and manufacturing, FreeCAD is the world leading open source software solution for bringing concepts to reality using parametric design. FreeCAD is suitable for designing projects of all sizes including tools, boats, and even buildings. 

* **Create models from drawings and back again:** draw simple or complex sketches and transform your ideas into parts. FreeCAD lets you to build models from 2D geometry constrained shapes and use them to build assemblies. Production drawings are ready to be made with the high quality Draft workbench.

* **Own the data you create:** FreeCAD has an industry first <i>open</i> data format. This ensures data made with FreeCAD will always remain accessible to the people who work with it.

* **Designed for your needs:** FreeCAD is designed to fit a wide range of uses including product design, mechanical engineering and architecture, whether you are a hobbyist, programmer, experienced CAD user, student or teacher.

* **Cross platform:** FreeCAD runs on Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

Installing
----------

To download prebuilt packages, visit the
[Releases page](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases).

On Linux, FreeCAD is also available through most distribution's default package manager and their software center applications.

To learn more visit the [wiki Download page](https://wiki.freecad.org/Download)

Compiling
---------

FreeCAD requires several dependencies to correctly compile for development and production builds. The following pages contain updated build instructions for their respective platforms:

- [Linux](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_Linux)
- [Windows](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_Windows)
- [macOS](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_MacOS)
- [MinGW](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_MinGW)


Reporting Issues
---------

FreeCAD, unlike proprietary, closed source, solutions, relies heavily on the community to give feedback on problems, or issues, on their experience using the software. This process gives the developers insight to help make the software better.

To start the process of filing an issue:

- Consider visiting the FreeCAD forum to see whether or not your issue has been discussed. Please note that FreeCAD has over two decades of history and feedback that is over a few years old may not reflect the current state of the project. If in doubt, start a new thread!
- Search the issues page for any related issues. If no similar issues are found, a new issue can be created. Please read the issue template before submitting the new issue. A maintainer will likely get back within a few days. If you happened to start a new thread or found a related thread on the forums, please provide a link to and from it.
- Issue tickets are best suited to be from the latest development or stable releases from V1.0 and onward. Any other versions may have limited support from the community and maintainers.
- The version info can be obtained from `Help > About FreeCAD > Copy to clipboard`.
- Please don't forget to provide a repeatable step by step guide on how to reproduce the issue. This will help ensure a timely response from the developers.
- If an example file will help demonstrate the problem, feel free to provide one.
