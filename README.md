Overview
--------

* **Freedom to build what you want:**
with integrated tools for part design, analysis, documentation, assembly, and manufacturing, FreeCAD is the world leading open source software solution for bringing concepts to reality using parametric design. FreeCAD is suitable for designing projects of all sizes including tools, boats, and even buildings. 

* **Create models from drawings and back again:** draw simple or complex sketches and transform your ideas into parts. FreeCAD lets you to build models from 2D geometry constrained shapes and use them to build assemblies. Production drawings are ready to be made with the high quality Draft workbench.

* **Own the data you create:** FreeCAD has an industry first <i>open</i> data format. This ensures data made with FreeCAD will always remain accessible to the people who work with it.

* **Designed for your needs:** FreeCAD is designed to fit a wide range of uses including product design, mechanical engineering and architecture, whether you are a hobbyist, programmer, experienced CAD user, student or teacher.

* **Cross platform:** FreeCAD runs on Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.
