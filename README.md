FreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for 
CAD, MCAD, CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering 
and product design but also fits a wider range of uses in engineering, 
such as architecture or other engineering specialties. It is 100% Open 
Source (LGPL2+ license) and extremely modular, allowing for very 
advanced extension and customization.

FreeCAD is based on OpenCasCade, a powerful geometry kernel, features an 
Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model provided by the 
Coin 3D library, and a broad Python API. The interface is built with Qt. 
FreeCAD runs exactly the same way on Windows, Mac OSX, BSD and Linux 
platforms.

Precompiled (installable) packages are usually available from 
several sources as described on the FreeCAD download page:

Compiling
---------

Compiling FreeCAD requires installation of several libraries and their 
development files such as OpenCasCADe, Coin and Qt, listed in the 
pages below. Once this is done, FreeCAD can be simply compiled with 
cMake. On Windows, these libraries are bundled and offered by the 
FreeCAD team in a convenience package, on Linux they are usually found 
in your distribution's repositories and on Mac OSX and other platforms 
you will usually need to compile them yourself.
